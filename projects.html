      <br><p>I’ve always been passionate about learning foreign languages, so I speak fluently English and French along with my mother tongue Bulgarian. I want to improve and keep learning and some of my future projects are learning Spanish and Italian.<br></p>
      <p>Last year, I did a bilingual attestation in History in French writing a dissertation about the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain in the 18th century. It was entitled “England in 18th century – the pioneer of modernity.” There, I developed how the UK lay the foundations of the modern world. First of all, one of the most important things leading Great Britain to her ascent is Magna Charta which determines the form of government existing until nowadays. However, that’s not the only precondition since the United Kingdom has a rich history and at that time it was a colonial empire which assists in its future development. Then one by one come different inventions and technologies, making the progress from manual to mechanised labour. I am really fascinated by History and the subject I’ve chosen has a very strong impact on every sector today. Great Britain was the first to introduce the new technologies and discoveries which push to the development of the mankind to a whole new level.

        <p>Except for my main hobby which is reading, I’m an aspiring writer and I’ve written a bunch of books mostly in my native language and I’m planning to publish a book one day. My favourite genre is fantasy, but I also love romance and thrillers. I have many interests and I want to make a career from all of them – I can’t restrict myself to only one subject. Therefore, I’d like to develop a career closely related with design which is one of my most inherent qualities (I do web designs, I love editing images and I’m quite good at drawing.)
